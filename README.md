# Fish-Feeder
Simple fish feeder using an Arduino Uni, a plastic bottle and a simple low powered servo motor.

The plastic bottle is filled with food and a hole is punctured in the side of it. This hole will allow food to fall into the fish tank.
The servo motor is attached to the lid of the plastic bottle which will turn the bottle causing food to fall into the tank.
