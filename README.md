# Fish-Feeder
A simple fish feeder created using an Arduino Uni, a plastic bottle and a simple servo motor.

The plastic bottle is filled with food and a hole is punctured in the side of it. This hole will allow food to fall into the fish tank.

The servo motor is attached to the lid of the plastic bottle. The servo motor will turn the bottle. When the hole of the bottle is facing down it will drop food into the tank. No food will fall when the hole is facing upwards. The Arduino Uno is programmed to turn the bottle at 9am and 5pm and hence feed the fish twice a day.

See attached video for demonstration.
